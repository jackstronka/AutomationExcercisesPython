# RULES.md Compliance

Before proposing or implementing any change to this project:

1. **Read RULES.md** – Check the project rules at `RULES.md` in the project root.
2. **Verify alignment** – Ensure the proposed solution follows:
   - Rule 2: Timeouts from config (no hardcoded values without justification)
   - Rule 3: UI logic in Page Objects, use BasePage methods
   - Rule 8: WebDriverWait / ExpectedConditions, not Thread.sleep
   - Rule 12: Locator priority (ID → name → data-qa → CSS → XPath)
   - Rule 13: Correct ExpectedCondition for action (click → elementToBeClickable, etc.)
   - Rule 14: Prefer additive over destructive changes (add methods, don't change signatures)
3. **Avoid duplication** – Prefer shared utilities (e.g. Hooks) over duplicate logic in Page Objects.
4. **Document exceptions** – If rule cannot be followed (e.g. overlay blocks click), add a comment explaining why.
